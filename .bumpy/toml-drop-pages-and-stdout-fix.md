`peardrop local` gained `--spec`/`--spec-inline` TOML drop-page specs: multiple named fields (secret/text/file/token), per-field validation, and copy overrides, with client- and server-side validation and a resubmittable single-use link on failure (peardrop.fyi#15).

Also fixed `peardrop local` buffering its Drop URL / `--json` output behind un-awaited writes, so piped or backgrounded runs (how agents drive it) could see zero bytes for a long time. `--json` now emits compact single-line JSON, and SIGINT/SIGTERM exit cleanly with a session summary (#2).
